A website that shows latest data about coronavirus in the US. I used React, MySQL, and Express. The data for the website is from Johns Hopkins University (https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19). A graph on the website doesn't work on Safari. I'm trying to fix this issue. Please use Chrome to see the website.
