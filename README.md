A website that shows latest data about coronavirus cases in the US. I used React, MySQL, Bootstrap and Express to build it. The data for the website is from Johns Hopkins University (https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19). The graphs on the website doesn't work on Safari. I'm trying to fix this issue. Please use Chrome to see the website.
